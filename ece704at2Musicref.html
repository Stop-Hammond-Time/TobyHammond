						<h3>Arts/Teaching Practice Focus:</h3>
						<p>The focus for my practice in this experience is to work on my noticing and responding to students’ demonstrations of skill in order to maintain learning that is within the zone of proximal development for each individual.</p>
						
						<h3>Educational Dimensions CLIMER/Studio Habits of Mind:</h3>
						<p>Students CONNECT to a musical classroom culture that is nurtured by participatory music making. Students develop their music and pattern LANGUAGE. They explore their IDEAS of pattern and rhythm whilst MAKING rhythmic patterns. Learners RESPOND to the rhythmic patterns of their classmates and those of the video and educator.</p>
						
						<h3>Where to next?</h3>
						<p>This experience is particularly effective when implemented as part of a series. In my Cycle 1 class (ages 3-6), which receives a weekly hour of music lessons, I introduced the videos three weeks in advance, dedicating the first 10 minutes of each lesson to them and adjusting the difficulty as needed. In the fourth week, I followed the lesson plan mentioned earlier. Moving forward, I plan to repeat this lesson, introducing more complex elements or new content (such as additional rhythms, time signatures, or bar counts) to further the students’ learning. I will also place greater emphasis on selecting four beats per bar—each card representing one beat—as some students tend to exceed this count.</p>

						<p>Additionally, this method can be used to delve deeper into pattern exploration using large-scale forms. For instance, student-composed rhythms could be arranged in rondo (ABA, ABACA etc.) form, with each rhythm repeating four times, creating a composition that investigates patterns on a larger scale. The possibilities for exploring rhythmic patterns in composition are indeed limitless.</p>

						<p>Children’s learning would be enhanced by exposure to percussion music, such as African Drumming or Indian Konnakol. This gives them a chance to make connections to rich musical cultures, where the application for their learning is direct and obvious. I have had success in the past teaching both of these styles of music to this age group, and it would link excellently from this learning sequence.</p>

						<h3>Adaptations for inclusion:</h3> 
						Adjusting the difficulty or providing less experienced students a chance to practise at other times. Students who are sensitive to noise will be provided with ear muffs. Additionally, some students may not have the stamina or interest to focus on rhythm for so long. The experience has been written sequentially to focus on the interrelated activities, however splitting the activities up with music movement activities in between (such as the lesson plan that forms this portfolio), or over the day, or across multiple days may be beneficial for many students.</p>

						<p>These videos are great at visually connecting the music with the notation, and provide instant, self-assessed feedback for the students as they are playing. They are also self-differentiating as advanced students focus on developing their accuracy of reading the notation, whilst others build towards this while relying on their aural experience of the rhythms to assist with the repeats.</p>
