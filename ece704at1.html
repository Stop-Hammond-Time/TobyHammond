									<p>My creative piece takes the form of a musical composition and recording, arguing for music’s essential place in education by highlighting benefits of learning mathematics through music.</p>
									<p>It is also a reflection on the enriching teaching encounters I have had with students throughout the past year while integrating contemporary academic insights gained from my studies into my pedagogical approach. Despite being incredibly busy over the last year, juggling full-time studying and teaching, along with caring for two children under the age of 3, I found it easy to forgo reflection, and focus purely on the future. This composition serves as a musical scrapbook, allowing me to revisit these educational successes easily and enjoyably whenever I need ideas for future teaching. As such, much of the meaning and symbolism is personal and will be explained further.</p>
									<p>The recording features vocals, guitar, mandolin, violin, tin whistle, recorder, accordion, bodhran, and African djembes, all played by myself. I regularly incorporate these instruments into my day-to-day teaching. The piece was recorded with a single microphone and does not feature a very high recording standard. However, the focus of the work is on capturing the memories and ideas within it, as the intended audience is myself.</p>

									<h2>Section 1</h2>
									<p>The composition consists of four main sections. The first is a song that I wrote the lyrics for, matched to the melody of "Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star," aimed at children between three and six years old. It is in a much higher register than I would normally sing, as this was a tip I learned from Fiona during our online sessions for encouraging young children to sing. The song has accompanying hand actions that teach children to count by twos, a precursor to multiplication (Reys et al., 2022). It illustrates how music can be utilised in mathematics teaching, broadening the ways in which mathematical content is provided and allowing for differentiated learning. It also exemplifies teaching mathematics by drawing children’s attention to the mathematics within their work, as advocated by Björklund and Ahlskog-Björkman (2017).</p>

									<h2>Section 2</h2>
									<p>Musical patterns in pitch, rhythm, form, and structure offer students many ways to creatively engage with mathematics (MacDonald, 2018, p. 57). Many contemporary scholars emphasise the importance of pedagogical strategies fostering creativity within STEM education as it helps foster deep understandings (Ashbrook, 2016; Björklund & Ahlskog-Björkman, 2017; Shen & Edwards, 2017; Bergen, 2009; MacDonald, 2018; Marsh and Young, 2015).</p>
									<p>The second section symbolises the way arranging and understanding musical form engages mathematical thinking. It uses a simplified minuet and trio form (usually ABACDCABA), a common form in traditional Irish music, chosen as I was avoiding simplistic AB patterns for more potent educational patterns (Papic et al., 2011, as cited in Gifford, 2019). It is made up of an instrumental version of the song and a traditional Irish folk tune – ‘The Kesh Jig”, that I recently taught to students in an ultimately very successful inquiry based learning sequence on Irish music, where I realised the amazing opportunities for mathematics engagement and students agency in arranging music, which outweigh the benefits of students playing an expertly arranged performance by myself.</p>
									<p>The students, having already learned to play the song individually, collaborated to arrange it as an ensemble with various instruments. Initially, I provided guidance. However, I observed that they were fully capable of taking responsibility for the arrangement. They made decisions like “We’ll start with four beats on the drum and have just guitar and tin whistle for the first A section.” While the resulting arrangement may not have been as polished as if I had done it myself, the process allowed them to creatively engage with mathematics and design, and demonstrates the importance of releasing responsibility, as advocated by Amplify (Department of Education and Training, 2019).</p>

									<h2>Section 3</h2>
									<p>Since the previous inquiry, I have continued allowing students to take on arranging challenges. The third section of my piece is a shortened version of an arrangement made by students who I was teaching Western African Drumming. I really love teaching African drumming in my music classes, as it’s so accessible and inclusive, yet fun and educational even for accomplished musicians and mathematicians.</p>
									<p>While the second section emphasises the patterns in musical form, the Western African drumming section underscores the engagement of mathematical thinking with rhythmic patterns. This section is filled with complex and overlapping patterns and both structured and improvised call and response which, when broken down to learn, engage students' understanding of fractions.</p>
									<p>The extensive opportunities for students to engage with patterns in music is further highlighted in the call and response section (1:54). Call and response is an excellent opportunity for students to copy patterns, especially those that are more complicated than AB which is important, according to Papic et al. (2011, as cited in Gifford, 2019). However, Knaus (2015) underscores the importance of children not only being able to copy patterns, but also being able to explain and continue them. Opportunity for this in music is demonstrated at 2:05 where a steady rhythmic pattern repeats, which students would continue when playing. In learning this pattern, students worked collaboratively, with advanced students explaining the pattern to others, fostering a deeper understanding through explanation.</p>

									<h2>Section 4</h2>
									<p>The final section is a lullaby version of the initial song, to symbolise the way in which music and music education can be endlessly varied, simplified and adjusted to meet the abilities of all students.</p>

									<h2>Conclusion</h2>
									<p>Music is constructed of patterns, a deep understanding of which is integral to all areas of mathematics. Music is an important and potent tool for cross curricular learning, particularly where creativity can be utilised to promote deep understandings, over rote memorisation of facts, providing differentiated access and promoting excellence in modern education.</p>
