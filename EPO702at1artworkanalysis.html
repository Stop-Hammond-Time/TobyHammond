							<h1>Artwork Analysis</h1>

						<div style="text-align: center;">
							<img src="images/delusion.jpg" alt="The Great Delusion">
							<p class="image-caption" style="font-style: italic;">The image, which was not originally created by the uploader, can be found in a tweet by Bose (2020).</p>

						<p>This artwork is a digital cartoon. Despite my best efforts in reverse image searching I was unable to find the original author. The work is unsigned and has been edited and shared across many social media platforms.</p>
					
						<p>Digital literacy is becoming one of the most important literacies as social media and advertising become ever more prevalent in our lives. As such, I have chosen this artwork as it provides opportunities to think critically about what the artist is saying. The cartoon raises some excellent points for consideration and is very useful for generating inquiry questions, even if I disagree with the artist’s overall viewpoint.</p>
					
						<p>The artist juxtaposes the eco-conscious electric bike rider with the polluting electricity station arguing that people with the intention of being sustainable with electric bikes as their mode of transport are mistaken, as the electricity they use to power their bicycles is generated by burning fossil fuels in the same manner that cars do. I find this artwork to be frustrating for its oversimplified take on the issue. It does, however, elicit some important questions that are important considerations for sustainable transport and electric vehicles. Where does our electricity come from? How energy efficient are our vehicles? And how much energy do electric bicycles use compared to electric and petrol cars? In answering these questions, we find that the electric bicycle is far more sustainable than other vehicles with the exception of entirely human-powered transport (US Department of Energy, n.d.). Even when comparing cars, electric is more sustainable even if the electricity is generated by burning fossil fuels – and as society is moving towards more sustainable energy sources, this argument becomes even weaker. However, I appreciate the need to consider these points and the potential to improve even further in these areas.</p>

							<img src="images/Dublin.jpg" alt="Proposed Civic Plaza in Dublin">
							<p class="image-caption" style="font-style: italic;">Dublin City Council (2020). <a href="https://consultation.dublincity.ie/traffic-and-transport/proposed-extension-of-the-civic-plaza-at-college-g/">Proposed Extension of the Civic Plaza at College Green</a></p>
						</div>
					
						<p>The second artwork is also a digital illustration; however, the purpose is drastically different. This is an illustration from Dublin City Council (2020), and is concept art for proposed action to improve walking and cycling in Dublin. Its purpose is to have the audience imagine the possibilities and how it would feel if the city built this particular option in their plans. This helps the city collect data about what people want, and also aims to excite the public and garner support for the council. It utilises vibrant colours and stimulating subject matter to do this. This artwork makes me hopeful, as it demonstrates that an increasing amount of councils are realising the importance of and barriers to alternatives to car transport.</p>
