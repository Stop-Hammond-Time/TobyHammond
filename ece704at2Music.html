						<h3>WHO</h3>
						<p>Kindergarten and Prep (ages 3-6) – although this experience is appropriate for a wide range of ages, including adults. These children have had some experience playing percussion instruments in previous music sessions.</p>
						
						<h3>WHERE</h3>
						<p>Inside a Kindergarten classroom in an open sitting space.</p>
						
						<h3>OUTCOMES</h3>
						<p>Learning outcomes from (Victorian Curriculum and Assessment Authority [VCAA], 2018)</p>
						<h3>Communication – In how students communicate about music, through music and how music aids in language development (Krauss, 2022)</h3>
						
						<h5>Children begin to understand how symbols and pattern systems work</h5>
						<ul>
							<li>Students are exposed to symbols as a powerful means of communication.</li>
							<li>Ideas, thoughts and concepts can be represented through symbols when learners transform written notation into musical rhythms, and vice versa.</li>
							<li>Learners use the directionality of written text.</li>
							<li>Develop aural abilities that aid language development (Krauss, 2022).</li>
						</ul>
						
						
						<h5>Children interact verbally and non-verbally with others for a range of purposes</h5>
						<ul>
							<li>Children interact with one another both verbally and musically as they exchange rhythms for one another to copy, and discuss their patterns.</li>
							<li>Children also contribute their ideas in small and large group discussions as well as explain the mathematical ideas (patterns) within their work. They also identify, reproduce, and experiment with rhythmic and sound patterns (<a href="http://victoriancurriculum.vcaa.vic.edu.au/Curriculum/ContentDescription/VCELT243">VCELT243</a>).</li>
						</ul>
						
						<h3>ARTS LEARNING INTENTIONS</h3>
						<p>Children will learn to read and play rhythmic notation, as well as use these to create patterns. They will develop their ability to play in time and aural skills as they decode and repeat rhythms that they hear.</p>
						
						<h3>ARTS TERMINOLOGY</h3>
						<ul>
							<li><b>Beat:</b> The fundamental unit of time in music, serving as the primary pulse that determines the tempo of a piece.</li>
							<li><b>Rhythm:</b> A patterned recurrence of a beat over time, defined by the arrangement of musical sounds and silences.</li>
							<li><b>Count-In:</b> A preparatory signal given before the start of a performance to ensure a unified commencement among musicians.</li>
							<li><b>Minim (Half-Note):</b> A musical note with the duration of two beats in common time, represented by a hollow oval note head and a straight note stem.</li>
							<li><b>Crotchet (Quarter-Note):</b> A note that has a duration of one beat in common time, denoted by a filled oval note head and a straight stem.</li>
							<li><b>Quavers (Eighth-Notes):</b> Notes that are each one-eighth the duration of a whole note, typically connected by a beam in groups.</li>
							<li><b>Crotchet Rest (Quarter-Note Rest):</b> A symbol indicating a silence for the duration of one beat in common time.</li>
							<li><b>Half-Note Rest:</b> A rest that indicates a silence for the duration equivalent to two beats in common time.</li>
						</ul>
						
						<h3>RESOURCES AND PREPARATION</h3>
						<p><b>Resources:</b></p>
						<ul>
							<li>TV or digital display with a means of playing a YouTube video</li>
							<li>Cutout rhythm cards <a href="cards.pdf">(link to pdf)</a> (cut out and laminated) – the specific ones used will depend on the level of the students.</li>
							<li>Clapping sticks</li>
						</ul>
						
						<h3>SEQUENCE OF LEARNING</h3>
						<p><b>Visual musical mind’s rhythm videos</b></p>
						<p>Tell students that you’re going to play a game. Have them sit in a position where they can all see the screen, preferably in a semi-circle so that they can also see their peers – visual cues will assist their playing. Hand out two clapping sticks to each student (note that while proper clave stick technique can be taught here, it contributes to a noisier classroom environment).</p>
						
						<p>In the few seconds of the video, there is an opportunity to pause for a brief explanation of the notes. This should be kept brief as most children develop an understanding from the video itself.</p>
						<p>During the video, point to rhythms as you play them, vocalising them out loud at the same time. This scaffolding can be removed gradually, towards simply playing along, when you feel students are confident enough. The educator may not even need to play along if there are enough students playing accurately and confidently. An action of moving the sticks apart is often helpful in getting students to perform rests and the second beat of minims correctly.</p>
						
						<p>After completing the first video, choose to repeat or continue on to the next video based on student performance (and often at the eager request of students to try the more difficult level).</p>
						<p>Two videos should be enough, although three is fine if students are asking to do another.</p>
						
						<p><b>Constructing rhythms with rhythm cards</b></p>
						<p>Have students move to sitting in a circle. Demonstrate the composing of a rhythm (ta ta ti-ti ta for example) with the rhythm value cards and clap and vocalise it 4 times in a row with the students. All patterns should be in 4/4 time and should use 4 cards (or 3 if using a minim).</p>
						<p>Then ask for volunteers to help you choose rhythmic values for a new rhythm. Perform this 4 times, also.</p>
						<p>Then ask for a volunteer to create a rhythm on the floor. Perform 4 times. Repeat this 3 times.</p>
						<p>Hand out a set of rhythm value cards to each student, and ask them to create their own patterns. They can spread out across the classroom, working on the floor or at a table. Advanced students can take 4 sets and repeat their pattern below for each repeat.</p>
						<p>Move around to each student and ask them to tell you about their rhythm. Is it 4 beats long? Can they say and play it? Do they do so in time?</p>
						
						<p><b>Using patterns – call and response</b></p>
						<p>Have students pack up the cards and return to sitting in a circle. Explain that you are going to play and say a rhythm and that the students will repeat it 3 times. (Usually rhythms that end with a crotchet on beat 4 are best for getting students to respond). Continue playing along with students as they repeat your rhythm.</p>
						<p>Then, go around the circle and invite students to contribute a rhythm. Can they compose their own, ensuring that it is 4 beats long? Can they perform it in time accurately enough for other students to copy (if not, ask them what their rhythm is and perform it for them) after a 4 beat count in? Do they need time before to compose their rhythms, or can they improvise them in time?</p>
						
						<h3>EVALUATION</h3>
						<p>Assessment of learning will come from the patterns that children develop, both using the cards and verbally, and how well they are performed.</p>
						<p>Students at a high level will use a variety of rhythms and rest, and will perform them accurately and in good time. They will be able to perform a rhythm after a count of four accurately enough that students can repeat it afterwards. The preparation time needed before this is also an indicator of development. Students that can be called upon to create a rhythm spontaneously are performing at a much higher level than students who need to compose the rhythm beforehand, either on their own or with assistance (who may still be performing at a perfectly acceptable level for the age group and experience).</p>
