									<h1>Standard 1: Know students and how they learn</h1>
								</header>
								
								<h1>1.1 Understanding Physical, Social, and Intellectual Development in Children</h1>
								<p>I have demonstrated an understanding that the physical, social, and intellectual development of children not only affects learning but is also an integral part of it. These aspects of development are broad and non-linear, with children exhibiting a spectrum of abilities in each area.</p>
								<p><strong>Physical Development</strong></p>
								<p>Students’ physical development affects their ability to perform tasks. For instance, a child’s ability to hold a pencil impacts their writing and drawing skills, which in turn need to be developed to enhance their proficiency. I demonstrated this by teaching a small group of children to write letters, starting with letters they already knew. We focused on improving letter shapes while discussing and connecting phonics verbally to enhance learning, develop writing skills, and maintain engagement and fun.</p>
								<p><strong>Social Development</strong></p>
								<p>Children’s social abilities influence their wellbeing and their capacity to work collaboratively. These skills also need to be nurtured. By scaffolding and assisting children in resolving their disputes (distinct from solving their problems for them), I help them develop their social skills. Additionally, we encouraged group activities and incorporated ideas from a sociocultural perspective in my group pattern-making activities using shapes and paperclip chains, where turn-taking was a crucial component.</p>
								<p><strong>Intellectual Development</strong></p>
								<p>Children’s intellectual development determines the concepts they are ready to learn and their ability to assimilate new knowledge. Particularly in early childhood, deeply considered formative assessment is essential to gauge a child’s intellectual development across various domains. I demonstrated this with H (Holly) during our pattern shapes activity. I aimed to assess her current intellectual development in mathematics and patterns. After observing her ability to recognize ABC patterns with ease, I introduced her to an ABCB pattern and continued to assess to ensure the task was appropriate for her intellectual development.</p>

								<h1>1.2 Understanding How Students Learn</h1>
								<p>Children at this age learn through various methods, with the most effective being active engagement and idea contribution. Many inexperienced teachers may hold the misconception that simply telling students information is sufficient for learning. However, constructivism teaches us that students must construct their own knowledge.</p>
								<p>I demonstrated this constructivist approach in mathematics while teaching addition. We discussed the meaning of the symbols, using multiple examples and alternate explanations as needed. We explored the concept that addition, or "plus," is about putting things together and asking how many we have altogether. We then used counters to physically represent and explore these ideas. Students counted out counters into two groups matching their equations and then combined them.</p>
								<p>While I could have taught this as a rote process using one particular strategy – such as counting on, I chose to help them experience and understand what addition truly means. This approach fosters deep understanding of concepts over memorisation of procedures. Overall, this demonstrates my understanding of how students learn by employing strategies that engage them actively, accommodate diverse learning needs, and facilitate the construction of knowledge.</p>

								<h1>1.3 Students with Diverse Linguistic, Cultural, Religious, and Socioeconomic Backgrounds</h1>
								<p>I utilise a number of strategies that are responsive to the learning strengths and needs of students from diverse linguistic, cultural, religious and socioeconomic backgrounds</p>
                                <p>For example, I used targeted differentiation at my final primary school placement where I taught a child – who we’ll call “D”, whose first language is Polish. The planned lesson (not my own) was teaching the use of conjunctions by constructing a sentence that uses the word “because”, and another that uses the word “but”. The planned differentiation for the lesson was a worksheet that traced the words “because” and “but”. Realising that this was an entirely different task, when D began to struggle with the writing task, I instead differentiated his task to a verbal version and scribed for him. With some small assistance, he was able to understand and use the conjunctions verbally.</p>
								<p>I also use concrete materials to supplement communication. When teaching D subtraction, most other students understood the meaning of subtraction or minus. I checked in with D to ensure he was following and discovered that he was unfamiliar with the terms. I rephrased it as "take away" and demonstrated that subtraction in this context meant "taking away," using counters for non-verbal communication to support his language comprehension. Non-verbal communication, such as using visual aids and physical demonstrations, is another effective strategy for supporting linguistically diverse students.</p>
                                <p>Another example highlights the difference between placements in contrasting socioeconomic areas. In one placement, located in a more affluent area with an expensive sessional kindergarten, many students had at least one parent at home who provided one-on-one instruction. These students typically arrived at school knowing their letters and numbers. In contrast, during a more recent placement in a long daycare, in a lower socioeconomic area, I had to focus my teaching more on helping students understand the relationship between number and letter symbols and their actual meanings.</p>
                                <p>By adapting my teaching strategies to suit the diverse linguistic, cultural, and socioeconomic backgrounds of my students, I ensure that all students have the opportunity to understand and engage with the learning material.</p>

								<h1>1.6 Strategies to Support Inclusive Student Participation and Engagement in Learning Experiences (For Students Experiencing Disability)</h1>
								<p>In my teaching practice, I adopt a social model of disability rather than a medical model, focusing on students experiencing disability rather than having one. My approach centres on reducing their experience of disability by creating inclusive and supportive learning environments. For neurodivergent students, many of the strategies I use are beneficial for all students. As someone with ADHD, I have a special interest in understanding and catering to neurodivergent learners. Below are the strategies I employ to support inclusive participation and engagement for students experiencing disability:</p>
								<p><strong>Attention to Student Regulation:</strong> Monitoring students' regulation levels, particularly for those with ADHD, to prevent disruptive and antisocial behaviour. Educating students on understanding their feelings and desires and helping them develop productive strategies or take breaks as needed.</p>
								<p><strong>Movement Breaks:</strong> Incorporating movement breaks to stimulate students' balance and physical needs, which assists in regulating their behaviour, emotions and mental stimulation.</p>
								<p><strong>Executive Function Support:</strong> Providing up to 30 seconds for processing time, creating lists, reminders, and timers, and simplifying the delivery of instructions by giving one step at a time. These strategies aid students with lower executive function.</p>
								<p><strong>Sensory Needs Awareness:</strong> Being mindful of students' sensory needs by providing fidgets and other sensory tools, ensuring the environment is appropriately lit and not too noisy. Recognising and accommodating students' tics and stims, allowing them to engage in these behaviours as long as they do not negatively impact others.</p>
								<p><strong>Creating Safe Spaces for Stimming:</strong> For example, accommodating a three-year-old student, O, who stimmed by rolling back and forth on the floor. While this behaviour was disruptive and dangerous in the middle of the circle during group time, I organised a safe space where he could continue this activity while still hearing our discussion and rejoining the circle when ready.</p>
								<p><strong>Support for Visually Impaired Students:</strong> Making accommodations such as using Braille sheet music and developing aural abilities for totally blind students. Arranging seating so visually impaired students can see the whiteboard from a close distance that avoids glare.</p>
								<p><strong>Support for Wheelchair Users:</strong> I have changed seating arrangements for a student who used a wheelchair, to allow him easier access to a seat at a table, whilst still allowing him to sit with the rest of the students.</p>
								<p>By employing these strategies, I aim to create an inclusive learning environment that supports the diverse needs of all students, particularly those experiencing disability. This approach not only enhances their participation and engagement but also fosters a sense of belonging and inclusion within the classroom.</p>
