										<h2>Toby Hammond</h2>
										<p><strong>Music Educator | Classroom Teacher | Instrumental Tutor</strong><br> Victoria, Australia</p>

										<p>I am a provisionally registered Victorian teacher and music educator with experience across early years, primary, and secondary settings. My practice centres on creative, practical learning that builds strong relationships, supports neurodiverse learners, and fosters confident, engaged learning communities through music and the arts.</p>
										
										<p>I have designed and delivered whole-school and small-group music programs, led instrumental tuition across multiple age groups, and contributed to interdisciplinary learning through performance, composition, and project-based approaches. My work emphasises clear skill development alongside student agency, collaboration, and real-world musical application.</p>
										
										<p>Most recently, I played a key role in the development and delivery of music programs at Global Village Learning (GVL), where I was responsible for planning and teaching classroom music, instrumental programs, and ensemble experiences across a broad age range. This included designing sequential learning programs, supporting student performances and community events, and adapting curriculum to meet the needs of diverse learners. Through this work, I developed a strong reputation for building positive learning cultures and engaging students who benefit from flexible, inclusive approaches.</p>
										
										<p>Alongside classroom teaching, I work as an instrumental tutor and performing musician. I have experience supporting students in individual and group lesson contexts, preparing students for performances, and creating accessible pathways for students to continue developing musically beyond formal classroom settings.</p>
										
										<p>This site presents examples of my teaching practice, music projects, and education programs, and is intended for schools, families, and organisations seeking an educator with strong curriculum skills, practical classroom experience, and a passion for meaningful music education.</p>
