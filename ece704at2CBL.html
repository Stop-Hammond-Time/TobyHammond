							<h1>Exploring Patterns through Creative and Body-based Learning (CBL)</h1>
							<h2>WHO</h2>
							<p>Kindergarten and Prep (ages 3-6)</p>
							<h2>WHERE</h2>
							<p>Inside, outside or a mix of both as needed</p>
							<h2>OUTCOMES</h2>
							<p>From VCAA (2018).</p>
							<h3>Wellbeing</h3>
							<ul>
								<li>Especially through safe movement practices in dance that incorporate both locomotor and non-locomotor
									skills.</li>
									<li>Demonstrating spatial awareness, individuals navigate their surroundings with confidence and safety.
									</li>
									<li>Integrating both broad and precise motor skills along with balance, they develop intricate patterns of
										activity that encompass dance, creative movement, and drama.</li>
										<li>They engage with music by expressing themselves through movement.</li>
										<li>Displaying an enthusiasm for active play, they adeptly manage dance and movement areas, prioritising
											their own safety and that of others.</li>
										</ul>
										<h2>ARTS LEARNING INTENTIONS</h2>
										<p>Children will have the opportunity to develop gross motor, dance performance, and acting skills.</p>
										<h2>ARTS TERMINOLOGY</h2>
										<ul>
											<li><b>Tableau:</b> A static scene where participants use their bodies to create a picture or represent an
												idea without movement or speech.</li>
												<li><b>Gesture:</b> A movement of part of the body to express an idea or meaning.</li>
												<li><b>Rhythm:</b> A strong, regular, repeated pattern of movement or sound.</li>
												<li><b>Expression:</b> The process of making known one’s thoughts or feelings through body movements.</li>
												<li><b>Sequence:</b> A particular order in which related movements follow each other.</li>
											</ul>
											<h2>RESOURCES AND PREPARATION</h2>
											<p><b>Resources:</b></p>
											<ul>
												<li>"Pattern Fish" by Harris (2000)</li>
												<li>Music speaker with a playlist of non-vocal dance music, as lyrics can distract from the need to think
													about patterns (House music playlists label as ‘study music’ are often good for this)</li>
												</ul>
												<h2>SEQUENCE OF LEARNING</h2>
												<p>Read Pattern Fish as a group with the class either directly before, or at some point earlier in the day with
													the students.</p>
												<p>Pick a page from the book – avoiding the first page – and show it to students whilst calling out the pattern
												from the page. Ask student to act out each part of the pattern. For example, on the ‘Bubble, Bubble, Pop!’
												page, ask students “How would we act out ‘bubble’?”, calling out students who give a good attempt and
												copying their acting to model for the rest of the class. Try to encourage creative ideas without specific
												instructions.</p>
												<p>Do the same for ‘pop’ and then ask students to model the pattern, “Bubble, Bubble, Pop!” together as a class.
												Give students some time to explore it on their own before instructing them to join all as a class, in time
												to your chanting.</p>
															<p>Then, inform students that they are going to form a tableau, explaining that it is when people construct an
																idea with their bodies. Then assist students to stand in a semi-circle (so they can see one another) whilst
																enacting a particular part of the pattern. For bubble, bubble, Pop, the first two students will be enacting
																‘bubble’ (a common action by class consensus) followed by the third student who will be enacting ‘pop’.
																These actions needn’t be static.</p>
																<p>Ideally students will do this, negotiating amongst themselves without educator guidance, however assistance
																	may be necessary, especially in asking more vocal and advanced students to allow other students the chance
																	to figure out what part of the pattern is needed when they are moving into their spot.</p>
																	<p>Finally, students will be invited to dance the pattern to music, welcoming alternate ways of representing the
																		pieces of the pattern.</p>
																		<p>Repeat this for as many pages as time and student interest allows, with a final chance for students to dance
																			whichever patterns they like at the end. Be sure to encourage students for their effort and ask students
																			“What pattern are you dancing?”</p>
																			<h2>EVALUATION</h2>
																			<p>Evaluation will involve noticing the patterns students make when they are dancing and acting individually. Do
																				they act out the pattern accurately? <br>Also, how students perform when forming the Tableau. Do they
																				demonstrate the ability to continue the pattern and organise themselves?</p>
