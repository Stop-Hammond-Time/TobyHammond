									<p>Living with ADHD myself, I understand the challenges that students with diverse learning needs face. Often these challenges stem from a lacking understanding of these sources of diversity and the helpful ways to cater to them in classrooms. These needs arise from various factors, including cultural background, physical or cognitive abilities, and neurodiversity. The Mparntwe Declaration (Department of Education, 2019) highlights the need to provide equitable education for those at risk of disadvantage, making it both a legal and ethical obligation <a href="https://stop-hammond-time.github.io/TobyHammond/standard7.html#7.2">[APST 7.2]</a>.</p>

<p>As a teacher, I have excelled in my ability to provide differentiation for tasks, both pre-planned and in responding in the moment to unique situations that arise. To this end, I focus on differentiation that provides access to the same learning goals as I highlight in <a href="https://stop-hammond-time.github.io/TobyHammond/standard1.html#1.3">APST 1.3</a> and <a href="https://stop-hammond-time.github.io/TobyHammond/standard1.html#1.6">APST 1.6</a>, one of my key learnings from reading Russo (2020) who highlights that many teachers often give struggling students a simpler and entirely different task, automatically applying a deficit approach and disadvantaging the student further. This has allowed me to tailor teaching to individuals’ ability, culture, and interests with great success.</p>

<p>Providing multiple pathways to the same learning is another way I cater to diversity in education. As a music teacher, I have also catered to diversity by teaching from many curriculum areas through music. This is particularly effective at engaging students in areas such as mathematics and literacy who are otherwise disengaged during teaching in those areas, due to either lack of interest, self-esteem, or neurodivergence. Björklund and Ahlskog-Björkman (2017) advocate for this kind of learning in mathematics, where the patterns within children's artworks are brought to their attention in order to extend their learning.</p>

<p>I have also used ICT to offer many pathways to the same learning, as I outline in <a href="https://stop-hammond-time.github.io/TobyHammond/standard2.html#2.6">APST 2.6</a>.</p>

<p>I have also engaged in and applied professional learning surrounding learners with ASD, including strategies for helping them manage their attention, behaviour, and interest in learning, as outlined in my portfolio <a href="https://stop-hammond-time.github.io/TobyHammond/standard5.html#5.4">[APST 5.4]</a>.</p>

<p>However, teaching for diversity is more than just catering to those with additional needs; teachers have a legal and ethical responsibility to be responsive to the diversity of every classroom as outlined by the Victorian Early Years Learning and Development Framework (VEYLDF) (Department of Education and Training (DET), 2016).</p>

<p>In response to this, I have sought to learn more about the contexts within which I teach. I engaged in a very informative conversation surrounding Ramadan with some Islamic parents, whilst I was teaching in an area with a high Muslim population allowing me to connect more knowledgeably with Islamic students during Ramadan, demonstrating interest and valuing their cultural practices. I was also able to facilitate respectful discussion within the classroom about religious festivals, connecting the learning with the students’ culture, and contributing to cross-cultural understanding within the classroom.</p>

<p>This is one of the many ways I have engaged with parents and carers. I have also engaged them in the educative process by helping provide learning opportunities as outlined in <a href="https://stop-hammond-time.github.io/TobyHammond/standard3.html#3.7">APST 3.7</a>.</p>

<p>Embracing indigenous cultures in Australian classrooms is outlined in the Mparntwe Declaration as particularly important. I have applied myself within units of my study that concern Indigenous education, allowing me to apply teaching strategies that are responsive to Indigenous cultures and ways of learning, in addition to the strategies for teaching to diverse classrooms mentioned above.</p>

<p>Finally, I have engaged with broader teaching communities to expand my skills as outlined in <a href="https://stop-hammond-time.github.io/TobyHammond/standard7.html#7.4">APST 7.4</a>.</p>
